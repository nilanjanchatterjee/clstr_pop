Estimate number of clusters using number of individuals captured 

I primarily developed it using photocaptures from camera-traps but it can also be extended to other sampling methods like genetic sampling.
Also, once the number of clsuters are estimated, individuals of each cluster can also be estimated using a detection function incorporting the number of missed individuals of any particular cluster.
